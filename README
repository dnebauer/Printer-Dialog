This script's intention is to simplify printing of text. It provides
a dialog to make many many printer settings before starting to print.
E.g. select:
  - printer device
  - font and its size
  - format of paper
  - colorscheme
  - line-numbering
  - ....

Pressing <Leader>pd opens the Printer Dialog in which you can make your
settings and start/cancel printing.

You can print either the whole contents of a buffer or a part of it.
If you want to select a whole buffer for printing, press <Leader>pd.
If you want to print only a part of a buffer, visually select this part and
press <Leader>pd.
